# Proposal: Abilities from Weapons
This is an attempt at solving two problems:
1. We don't have a good system for learning abilities.
2. Our itemization is limited and lacks variety.

My proposal is to link special abilities with particular items.  This has the benefit of
making items more interesting, and also gives us a way to learn abilities.

Now, the abilities list might look something like:
```
(WASD) Normal attack
(Ctrl+WASD) Melee special attack
(Shift+WASD) Ranged special attack
(Alt+WASD) Movement ability
```

## Example items

* Bronze Sword: 4 base damage, 8 special attack damage
* Iron Sword: 6 base damage, 10 special attack damage + Knockback
* Steel Sword: 8 base damage, 12 special attack damage + Stun
* Iron Shield: 8 special attack damage + Knockback
*
